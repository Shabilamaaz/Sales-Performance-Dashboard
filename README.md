# Sales Performance Dashboard (Excel Project)

## About This Project

This is an Excel dashboard project where I analyzed sales data using Pivot Tables and charts.  
The goal was to understand sales performance, profit distribution, and product trends in a clear visual format.

In this dashboard, I worked on:

- Monthly sales trend analysis  
- Region-wise sales and profit comparison  
- Product category distribution  
- KPI summary (Total Sales, Profit and Quantity)
