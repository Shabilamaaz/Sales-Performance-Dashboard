This is an Excel dashboard project where I analyzed sales data using Pivot Tables and charts.

In this dashboard, I worked on:

- Monthly sales trend analysis

- KPI summary (Total Sales, Profit and Quantity)

## Key Numbers

- Total Sales: ₹ 42,10,900  
- Total Profit: ₹ 7,63,700  
- Total Quantity Sold: 644  

## What I Used

- Microsoft Excel  
- Pivot Tables  
- Pivot Charts  
- Dashboard design techniques  

This project helped me practice data cleaning, pivot analysis, and dashboard formatting.
